We use computer vision to detect 3 ecosystems which are Arduino,ROS and IoT components. 
OpenCV that we used is PyCharm.
Each ecosystems have atleast 2 items.

Arduino - Arduino Uno, Arduino Mini
ROS - robots, robotic wheels
IOT - ultrasonic sensor, resistor, capacitor, jumper wire


It is also connected to webpage via real time data to provide user-friendly interface. http://127.0.0.1:5000/
